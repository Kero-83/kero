# Desktop Environment
I used GNOME because I feeled like it is easier to reach the look what I want with it but I forgot that GNOME is a VRAM killer :(

Now, I am still using gnome but I installed KDE recently because I found that I can reach the same look with it and for me KDE so powerfull than GNOME, so I am planning to switch KDE in the future.

And Here's The Current Look of My Desktop
